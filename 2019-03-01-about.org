Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.
it does not require particular tools or libraries (except for some basics standard libraries such as bottom.py).
It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more regularly than the core Flask program.
Flask is commonly used with MongoDB, which gives it more control over databases and history.
Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest, LinkedIn, and the community web page for Flask itself.

this mini project was performed just for fun, and officially, for method seeking.
